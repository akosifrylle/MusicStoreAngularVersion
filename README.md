MusicStoreAngularVersion
========================

WebAPI and Angular

This project is the famous MusicStore. A sample project in ASP MVC3. I re-created it and used Fluent Nhibernate for its ORM instead of EN framework.
Aside from that I'm now gradually converting it into SPA using Angular JS and WebApi. Really kewl!

NOTE: Please create a database named music_store and you're all set! :)
